# MIAAS-Medical-Information-and-Imaging-Analysis-System

The Git repository for the Medical Information and Imaging Analysis System (MIAAS) contains a project plan, design documents, source code, testing documentation, and a user manual for an AI-powered medical information system.

# Project Description

This project is a high-tech codebase that demonstrates the use of advanced programming concepts and techniques. It includes a set of API endpoints for managing patients, doctors, and hospitals, as well as a suite of unit tests and integration tests for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the code.

## Features

1. FastAPI framework for building high-performance web applications
2. PostgreSQL and MySQL databases for storing and retrieving data
3. Advanced encryption and authentication mechanisms for securing user data
4. Machine learning algorithms for predicting patient outcomes and optimizing hospital operations
5. Comprehensive test suite for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the code
